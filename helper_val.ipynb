The glitch, which occurred during peak trading hours, led to widespread confusion and temporary suspension of trading activities. However, the LSEG's prompt response and effective resolution mitigated the impact on investors and restored stability to the market.\\n\\nThe trading glitch, initially triggered by a technical malfunction within the LSEG's trading systems, resulted in erratic price movements and erroneous trade executions. This unexpected turn of events raised alarm bells and prompted the exchange to take immediate action to safeguard the integrity of the market.\\n\\nThe LSEG's technical teams, comprising experienced professionals, swiftly identified the root cause of the glitch and initiated a systematic investigation to rectify the issue. Their expertise and coordinated efforts enabled them to resolve the problem within a relatively short period, restoring normal trading operations and minimizing potential losses for investors.\\n\\nDuring the temporary suspension of trading, the LSEG maintained open lines of communication with market participants, ensuring transparency and timely updates. The exchange's proactive approach in managing the situation helped to reassure investors and maintain confidence in the stability of the market.\\n\\nRegulators and industry experts have commended the LSEG for its rapid response and effective resolution of the trading glitch. The exchange's robust contingency plans and backup systems played a vital role in minimizing the disruption and restoring normalcy.\\n\\nWhile the incident did cause temporary uncertainty, the LSEG's ability to swiftly address the issue underscores the resilience of the global financial system. It serves as a reminder of the continuous efforts made by exchanges and regulators to monitor and maintain the integrity of trading platforms.\",\n",

       " '‘Inflation … is not quite where we would like to see it.’\\n\\nLesetja Kganyago speaking in an interview on Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Image: Hollie Adams/Bloomberg\\n\\nSouth African Central Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago ruled out cutting interest rates while inflation remains persistent.\\n\\n“Our real rates are not particularly high and inflation has come down – it’s within target – but it is not quite where we would like to see it,” Kganyago said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\\n\\n“And if we are to make any policy adjustments, we would have to see that inflation has declined to our anchor, which is 4.5%.”\\n\\nThe South African Reserve Bank has held its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a 14-year-high of 8.25% since May 2023 and is expected to do so again when it meets next week.\\n\\nWhile inflation moderated toward the end of last year, the Reserve Bank has repeatedly said it is not convinced that price pressures are slowing to the midpoint of its 3% to 6% target band in a sustainable manner.\\n\\nInflation eased to 5.5% in November from 5.9% the prior month, primarily due to a sharp decline in fuel prices, although pressure in other categories such as food remain elevated. December inflation data will be released on January 24, one day before Kganyago announces the rate decision of the monetary policy committee.\\n\\nRead: SA’s inflation slows in November\\n\\nHigher for longer\\n\\nWhile pandemic-inflicted supply constraints responsible for propelling price pressures have eased, “inflation is still stubbornly high,” he said. “For it to be eventually conquered, we are going to have to keep rates higher for longer.”\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank will also watch South Africa’s public finances, which face spending pressures ahead of an election later this year in which the ruling African National Congress could lose its national majority for the first time since the end of White-minority rule in 1994.\\n\\nThe governor has repeatedly cautioned that the state of the country’s finances can dim the economic outlook and elevate borrowing costs. The central bank has also called out the burden imposed on business by repeated power cuts and snarled infrastructure due to the poor performance of the country’s electricity utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. and port and freight-rail operator Transnet.\\n\\nFinance Minister Enoch Godongwana is expected to warn of the country’s deteriorating debt trajectory when he presents the annual budget later next month. Kganyago declined to comment directly on the budget, but said he took the Treasury at its word that it would keep the country on a sustainable fiscal path.\\n\\nRead: Godongwana warns of difficult budget next month\\n\\n“I have got no reason to second guess them,” he said. “I have got every reason that if they have made a commitment, they will meet that commitment. But fiscal policy is not going to be easy this year.”\\n\\n© 2024 Bloomberg',\n",
